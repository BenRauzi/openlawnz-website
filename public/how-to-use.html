							<h2 class="body-title">Laws 001</h2>
							<p>
								Not quite Laws 101, this is a quick guide into the principles of how to do legal
								research in New Zealand.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">What is law?</h3>
							<p>
								Law in New Zealand is mostly made up of legislation (Acts of Parliament) and case law
								(decisions of Judges in Courts).
							</p>
							<p>
								Case law applies and interprets legislation, and it can be helpful for understanding how
								legislation works. Sometimes the Courts can make their own law too.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can view and browse all of New Zealand’s legislation at the Parliamentary Counsel
								Office website, legislation.govt.nz.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can use OpenLaw NZ to find case law that might help you find the answer to a legal
								question. This is how.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">New Zealand Court structure</h3>
							<p>
								First, understand the Courts structure. The Court system in New Zealand is structured in
								a hierarchy. From top to bottom:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The Supreme Court</li>
								<li>The Court of Appeal</li>
								<li>High Court</li>
								<li>District Court (including Family Court and Youth Court)</li>
								<li>Tribunals (including the Disputes Tribunal and others)</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Decisions of courts higher in rank are binding on those of lower rank. That is, given
								the same legal issue, a decision of the Supreme Court must be followed by all lower
								courts.
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, if you have a legal question, decisions issued by higher courts will be the
								most useful for telling you what the law is and how it should be applied. If you can
								find a Supreme Court case on topic, that will be the most authoritative and useful,
								because anything the Supreme Court says, all other Courts must follow.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">
								How to find an answer to a legal question
							</h3>
							<h4 class="body-title">Step 1 – identify the relevant law</h4>
							<p>
								The easiest place to start is with the section (or sections) of an Act of Parliament
								that apply to your situation. For example, if you want to know about parenting orders,
								you need to find law about section 48 of the Care of Children Act 2004.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you have a legislation title and section, or even just a legislation title, go to the
								next step.
							</p>
							<p>
								If not, you can either see if you can find the relevant Act by reviewing relevant
								government websites (they will normally tell you what legislation is relevant) or
								searching on legislation.govt.nz. It might take you a few tries, but search through the
								legislation until you have at least one section that you think is relevant to your
								situation.
							</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">
								Step 2 – Confirm the section is relevant and understand how it is applied
							</h4>
							<p>
								Once you have a section of an Act, you can look at case law. Case law will help you
								understand what that section means and how it is applied.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can use OpenLaw NZ to find case law that talks about sections in two different ways:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Use the Advanced Search. Choose “Legislation” from the drop down. Enter the title of
									the Act, and the section number.
								</li>
								<li>
									Use the Chrome Extension (if you’re using the Chrome web browser). Install the
									extension, then navigate on legislation.govt.nz to the section you’re interested in.
									Click the OpenLaw NZ button to view a list of cases that talk about it.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Alternatively, you can use OpenLaw NZ fulltext search to find cases with relevant facts
								or law. See below for some guidance on how you can use our search.
							</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">Step 3 – Find related cases</h4>
							<p>
								Once you have a case, it might be helpful to see if other cases talk about it. If lots
								of cases talk about it, that is generally a sign that it is an important case. Likewise,
								it is important to check that the case has not been overruled by a higher Court.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the case you've found is not quite right for your situation, you could look at cases
								cited by the case for further guidance on the relevant legal principles. If the case
								refers to another case and indicates that the other case is more authoritative or
								important, you should check that other case.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can navigate to and see other cases cited by a case (cases referred to by the
								present case), or other cases that cite a case (other cases that refer to the present
								case), using the information on the right side of the page.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="using-search" class="content-section">
							<h2 class="body-title">Using the Search</h2>
							<p>
								OpenLaw NZ search allows the following search syntax (in the main fulltext search field
								- not specific field searches like category or court).
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">Boolean search</h3>
							<p>The following operators are enabled:</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">Phrases ""</h4>
							<p>
								Search for specific phrases by putting them in quotes. For example,
								<code>"rescue helicopter"</code> will search for that exact phrase.
							</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">OR operator "OR" or ||</h4>
							<p>
								The OR operator is a vertical bar or pipe character. For example:
								<code>wifi || luxury</code> will search for documents containing either "wifi" or
								"luxury" or both.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>OR is the default conjunction operator</strong>, so you can also leave it out:
								<code>wifi luxury</code> is the equivalent of <code>wifi || luxury</code>.
							</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">AND operator "AND", "&&" or "+"</h4>
							<p>
								The AND operator is an ampersand or a plus sign. For example:
								<code>wifi && luxury</code> will search for documents containing both "wifi" and
								"luxury". The plus character (+) is used for required terms. For example, +wifi +luxury
								stipulates that both terms must appear somewhere in the field of a single document.
							</p>
							<h4 class="body-title">NOT operator "NOT", "!" or "-"</h4>
							<p>
								The NOT operator is a minus sign. For example,
								<code>wifi –luxury</code> will search for documents that have the wifi term and do not
								contain the term luxury.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">Fuzzy search</h3>
							<p>
								A fuzzy search finds matches in terms that have a similar construction, expanding a term
								up to the maximum of 50 terms that meet the distance criteria of two or less. For more
								information, see Fuzzy search.
							</p>
							<p>
								To do a fuzzy search, use the tilde "~" symbol at the end of a single word with an
								optional parameter, a number between 0 and 2 (default), that specifies the edit
								distance. For example,
								<code>"blue~"</code> or <code>"blue~1"</code> would return "blue", "blues", and "glue".
							</p>
							<p>
								Fuzzy search can only be applied to terms, not phrases, but you can append the tilde to
								each term individually in a multi-part name or phrase.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">Proximity search</h3>
							<p>
								Proximity searches are used to find terms that are near each other in a document. Insert
								a tilde "~" symbol at the end of a phrase followed by the number of words that create
								the proximity boundary. For example, <code>"hotel airport"~5</code> will find the terms
								"hotel" and "airport" within 5 words of each other in a document.
							</p>
							<h3 class="body-title">Wildcards</h3>
							<p>
								You can use <code>*</code> for multiple and <code>?</code> for single character wildcard
								searches. For example, a query expression of search=alpha* returns "alphanumeric" or
								"alphabetical".
